Any movable piece in the same row or column is pushed in that direction, unless a non-movable piece is obstructing the source of wind. <span>I took a break from regularly working on the game, but I have made (or am beginning to make) some major breakthroughs, one being clickable editor icons.</span><span><br/></span></p>
<p>The game and its editor are <a href="http://dvdfu.github.io/gem-puzzle-online/">playable here</a>. Use Enter to switch between the editor/game, use Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+Y in the editor to undo moves. Click for everything else: the empty red square is tentatively the eraser. It&#8217;s probably useless having this released since no one knows how to play the game well enough to make levels, but there were a few things I had to test (for example, your created level will save between page visits).</p>
<p>Somehow, the editor icons took a while to implement. Right now most of my work is going into the game structure: the way the game switches between screens, applies input to active screens, and so on. It&#8217;s basic for sure, but definitely involves a lot of thinking.</p>
