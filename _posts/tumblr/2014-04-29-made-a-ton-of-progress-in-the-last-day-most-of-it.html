Most of it is documented on Github but the gist is I&#8217;ve fully nailed down movement (still &#8220;corner&#8221; cases that need some addressing, literally).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more consideration involved for physics objects such as jumping springs, or moving platforms, but I&#8217;ll get to those when I have to. For now, 4-sided collision and jump-through-the-bottom-platforms have been created. The player movement is accelerated and the camera pans smoothly. Everything is going well so far.</p>
<p>I do wish I knew how efficient my methods are, though. I&#8217;ve tried to optimize calculations but I don&#8217;t know how well they will fare when the game is scaled up. Tile maps begin tearing when a full background of tiles is rendered. I&#8217;ll just have to see what can be done.</p>
