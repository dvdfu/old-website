<p>My puzzle game was made to be a short game that I could rapidly develop in only a small number of months. However, I&#8217;ve hit a point where most of the work is going into things like menus and UI instead of core gameplay mechanics. As development speed dies down, so does my interest, and rather than twiddling my thumbs I&#8217;m just going to pick up something else I can work on efficiently (for now). It makes more sense for me to work on a ton of &#8220;stub&#8221; games rather than try to push out a big one. The experience I get really accelerates the game making process. It&#8217;s already showing.</p>
<p>The game will be mostly menu-less and arcade-like, so I could focus solely on programming the gameplay. This one plays something like Super Crate Box, but was built based off a really old Mario Bros. PC fan game. The fan game had a mini-game involving surviving endless waves of Goombas/Koopas. You can look up the mini-game online: it&#8217;s called Mario Minix, and it&#8217;s actually the game that got me interesting in game making when I was 11.</p>
<p>Not much can be said about the gameplay at this point, but ideally it works by having the player (yellow thing) jump on an enemy (green square) and tossing the stunned enemy around into other enemies. The goal would be to last as long as possible. I&#8217;ve had some ideas about cycling through randomized powerups, similar to Super Crate Box but closer to The Binding of Isaac.</p>
