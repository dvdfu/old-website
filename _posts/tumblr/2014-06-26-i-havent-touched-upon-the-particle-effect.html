The game knows to pull Poolable objects out of a &#8216;pool&#8217; before resorting to making new ones. This way, objects can recycled, reducing memory use. This works perfectly for objects that are created in large amounts or with high frequency; i.e. particles, bullets, effects&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span>This is exactly what I used when I made the flashy sparkles in the images above (I really love using particles). </span><span>The game is a grid-based puzzle game that is themed around gems. The goal of the game is to collect every gem in a given level - no extras. There are many ways to &#8216;collect&#8217; gems, and many other gameplay elements that I am working on and won&#8217;t really go into at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, I used <em>really</em> simple placeholder sprites. I plan to make the real game look really pretty - possible with painted images instead of low resolution sprites like I usually use.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this will be the first project I see to completion. I picked something a little less complicated to program (although it turns out, it&#8217;s still somewhat complicated). It&#8217;s being developed for Android and desktop, but mainly Android.</span></p>
