Unfortunately, that also means I don&#8217;t have a clue about what I&#8217;m doing. I accidentally erased all of Glove Puncher (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4534702/glovepuncher.jar">though you can still download and play it</a>). It&#8217;s very unfortunate. But it was also just a prototype of something much bigger; more on that later.</p>
<p>In terms of working progress, I fully learned animation and input processing implementation thanks to <a href="http://neetlife2.blogspot.ca/">this guy</a>. I&#8217;m a bit surprised these functions aren&#8217;t built in, but they&#8217;re quick fixes and allow for a ton of flexibility. Likewise, I made some moderate changes from the original source code provided. The screenshot is just a Box2D rectangle bouncing up and down, while cycling through 4&#160;32x32 sprites. Also, the console outputs text on key presses (not holding keys, though) to test the input processor.</p>
<p>Lastly, but most importantly, I&#8217;m starting to understand what game development really entails. I&#8217;ve been reading up on some insightful posts around the Internet - Derek Yu, Tommy Refenes, /r/gamedev. Here&#8217;s a brief summary:</p>
<ul><li>I used to look down on high level game engines such as Game Maker, etc. But, it&#8217;s painfully obvious that the end product is all that matters. Rolling out content is the most important, so whatever works, works.</li>
<li>Likewise, being able to show a fully finished product is your goal - how you got there isn&#8217;t what people will look for.</li>
<li>The definitive aspect of people who make games is the ability to have a vision and carry it through to the end. The quality of the game depends on everything else, but you can&#8217;t make games if you can&#8217;t meet your goals.</li>
<li>Hard work is so, so important. And it might not always be where you think it should go, either. A lot of it happens in planning - and after, polishing. An author may spend a long time writing a book, but most of the work is certainly not spent <em>typing</em> it. Same with video games.</li>
<li>Productivity helps with working hard. Github&#8217;s Contribution Activity is actually an incredible way of documenting productivity, and motivating, too.</li>
</ul><p>A lot of that should come as intuitive, but it really changes what I think about game development - for the better.</p>
<p>I originally started the blog to act like a personal journal of things I&#8217;ve learned. ButÂ <span>I think my posts here should now focus more on the games I make themselves and less on how I&#8217;m making them (if not, then just a bit less).</span></p>
