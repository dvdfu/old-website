Tiled exports files in a .tmx format, which is supported by libgdx. I most likely won&#8217;t need it until long into game development, but I might as well start now.</p>
<p>I also got gdx-texturepacker.jar, a UI for the texture packing program, understand using animation classes, and have set the icon for the android app.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now running into problems with file handling: since each version (desktop, android) of the game exists in a separate folder, they have different directories relative to the location of game assets, so I have some problems detecting files. This wasn&#8217;t a problem in Drop because the project was not created using the libgdx setup UI. I believe the answer lies somewhere in folder redirection.</p>
<p>Researching helps a lot, but there are some things that just can&#8217;t be learned without repetition. I think I&#8217;m going to run into that a lot while making the games.</p>
