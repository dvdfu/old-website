Lightweight-ness and functionality were priorities. I found mtPaint: it did the job, so I&#8217;m sticking with it.</p>
<p>These two sprites are recreations of sprites from Bloberynth, the first game I ever made (on Game Maker, when I was 11). I feel like these iconic tiles will become stock images for testing in the future.</p>
<p>My ventures into libgdx were minimal today, but I did look into packing textures. TexturePacker2 is a built in libgdx tool that stores every image in a given directory into a &#8220;packed&#8221; image that requires less memory to load. This greatly optimizes speeds in games that have a large library of assets.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very neat tool. I need to learn how to import the packed image and create libgdx textures out of it. It&#8217;s my next step for making shiny-looking games.</p>
