A did a quick exercise to load maps:</p>
<ol><li>Using Tiled, I created very simple tiled maps (on the right) andÂ saved the .tmx and tileset image files into the game assets folder</li>
<li>I read the files and iterated through each tile on a specified tile layer. Non-null tiles were given &#8220;bodies&#8221; and added to the &#8220;world&#8221;</li>
<li>The map is drawn using a camera and the Box2D debugger renderer, i.e. there were no sprites used, only the outlines as specified when I define the body shapes</li>
</ol><p>There is a much more in-depth implementation of Box2D which involves specifying metrics, body properties, and more things I would use if I were interested in a physics-heavy game.</p>
<p>I neglected using a tool that chains connected bodies, which would be useful for solid platformer blocks in avoiding &#8220;ghost&#8221; collisions. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ll approach when I have a greater understanding of Box2D terminology. Box2D seems like a pretty useful thing to learn, especially considering it&#8217;s cross-platform, so I&#8217;ll have that if I ever jump to Flash or C++. Apparently games on the Wii and DS have used Box2D, if you can trust Wikipedia.</p>
