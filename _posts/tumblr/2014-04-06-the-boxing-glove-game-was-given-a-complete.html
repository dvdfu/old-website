Now, the objective is to pull the glove left, and release it to punch incoming blocks. I redid the engine from scratch and create object classes that extended the Rectangle class.</p>
<p>The movement is much smoother and the game uses delta time to simulate slow motion when the blocks are punched. The glove class is modeled like a FSM. Digital circuits class actually has some neat applications - it&#8217;s really interesting to implement abstract concepts from courses I&#8217;m taking directly into my game.</p>
<p>The blocks generate animated debris on destruction. I realize animations are more limited than I previously thought, and I am still trying to distinguish between image classes such as Sprite, Texture, Region, along with concepts such as texture packing and animation. They seem to have roughly the same functionality as far as I can tell.</p>
