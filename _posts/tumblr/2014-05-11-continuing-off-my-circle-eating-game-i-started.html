<p>I started to turn the project into really general examples of games based off of circles. The picture shows a solar system simulator where planet orbitals are determined by Newton&#8217;s Law of Universal Gravitation. The &#8216;simulation&#8217; works under a controlled environment (pictured above) but I ran into a ton of problems</p>
<ul><li>The simulation isn&#8217;t time-scalable. Speeding up or slowing down time actually changes the paths of the orbitals, where it SHOULD just change how fast they move along the same orbitals. This is my fault because I&#8217;m bad at physics</li>
<li>Outside a narrow range of values, the orbitals are incredibly erratic. This makes some sense</li>
<li>Force calculation time is reasonable, but it&#8217;s in quadratic time and would perform tremendously worse when more and more planets are added</li>
<li>I&#8217;m terrible with the coordinates. I tried to make planets add-able by click, but the camera and view manipulations have made it less simple.</li>
</ul><p>Next steps: I kind of want to make a collision simulator? Like, billiards, possibly using Box2D. I really want to complete just one game idea, no matter how small, but that&#8217;s always a big time investment when you worry about graphics and polishing.</p>
