Without properly initializing and updating an OrthographicCamera, nothing is displayed properly. I don&#8217;t know the precise purpose of the OrthographicCamera yet besides mapping display/input coordinates, which would be useful when running the same program on multiple platforms i.e. mobile.</p>
<p>Otherwise, not too much coding done today, but I learned a lot about libgdx and have a more solid understanding of what it&#8217;s capable of and how I should approach it. Using libgdx is accepting that a lot of my work will go into the backend of the game, more precisely tuning the game&#8217;s engine so that it matches my needs. While it would be nice to focus mostly on frontend and pushing out as many games as possible, I don&#8217;t feel personally accomplished if I can&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t work on making the game <em>work</em>. So libgdx is actually very well suited for me.</p>
<p>I also encountered a very nice <a href="http://neetlife2.blogspot.ca/">blog/tutorial series</a> that has a ton of information relevant to what I&#8217;m going to be working on.</p>
<p>My current goal is to just chip away at libgdx until I can make a new game template with ease. That level of familiarity will be really helpful. It&#8217;s a big time investment so I really hope I picked the right framework to go with.</p>
