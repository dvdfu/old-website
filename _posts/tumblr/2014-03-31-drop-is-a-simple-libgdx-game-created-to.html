My modifications to this game mark my first steps into libgdx and mobile game development in general.</p>
<p>Whether or not I stick to developing games in Java, I would like flexibility to a far greater depth than standard game engines. To me, part of making games is intensive programming and when I claim to have made a game, I want the claim to be greater than having simply provided its assets and assembling pre-built game engine functions. This is why I chose libgdx. I don&#8217;t know for how long I&#8217;ll be using it, but I hope to make at least one complete project before looking for other libraries/platforms.</p>
<p>Anyway, the initial game&#8217;s goal is to move a bucket underneath through endless stream of falling droplets as calming ambient rainfall plays in the background.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve re-purposed the game to emulate the gameplay of Flappybird, though you can actually stand and collide with the top and bottom of the &#8216;pipes&#8217;. Also, colliding with their sides doesn&#8217;t kill you, instead accumulating &#8220;Shame points&#8221;.</p>
<p>The background music features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GItw1qZLdsU">Blackout City</a> by Anamanaguchi.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking into improving the visuals and manipulating sprites before I look into the guts of the program.</p>
