It has literally no purpose, and &#8220;Hello World&#8221; is also displayed in tiny red letters.</p>
<p>The idea came from my platformer fighting game idea which uses the same kind of weapon. I was trying to wrap my head around rendering the spring portion of the weapon: which is slightly tricky, since I had to simulate rotation and translation with line coordinates to maintain uniform lengths. Combined with the oscillations, I had to use a bit of physics and geometry, which made me feel pretty cool.</p>
<p>I did it in a little under an hour. Nothing much was learned other than the ShapeRenderer class, which I used to render the lines. But created small applications as such is great practice anyway.</p>
<p>The sprite is from Spinmaster, and was taken from <a href="http://www.spriters-resource.com/resources/sheets/25/27751.png">The Spriter&#8217;s Resource.</a></p>
