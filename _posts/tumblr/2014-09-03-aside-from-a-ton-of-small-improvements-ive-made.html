I built off of a vignette shader in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caQZKeAYgD8">this tutorial</a>Â to cast a spotlight in the center of the screen tinted yellow, and also used basic wavy vertex shader to distort the output image completely. The results are very silly but also interesting.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad that I can finally make some sense of OpenGL&#8217;s shader language. A lot of it is actually very simple and there are plenty of features in the syntax that make writing shaders very quick. The only restriction is how creative you can be.</p>
