<p>After a bit more reading, maybe Box2D isn&#8217;t the best idea for a 2D platformer. I got it to do some really cool physics stuff, but overall it&#8217;s a lot more than required for simpler collisions. So I got rid of all that and rewrote really simple game object classes (along with classes for animation and input). I borrowed the neat little &#8220;debug rendering&#8221; from Box2D, which you can see in the picture above.</p>
<p>Plus, I made a somewhat more optimized map loader: instead of placing each block as its own square tile, the loader scans for successive rows and columns of blocks, and adds a bigger block in as one object. The extra loading time is a non-factor and I can picture this significantly reducing collision operation times or even glitchy collisions.</p>
<p>Then I finally got Github to do what I want, so overall a really good day for progress.</p>
<p>On one last note, here is a working rendering order, since up until now rendering has been flickering or delaying:</p>
<ul><li>register key inputs</li>
<li>move and THEN <span>update character</span></li>
<li>move and THEN <span>update camera</span></li>
<li><span>set tiled map renderer to camera</span></li>
<li><span>update sprite/shape batches using camera matrix</span></li>
<li><span>clear screen</span></li>
<li><span>draw objects, front-most objects last</span></li>
</ul>
