I really quickly added little stun stars above enemies when they&#8217;re stunned. The number of stars indicates how many seconds will pass before they resume activity. I enjoy including small details like these!</p>
<p>The enemy sprites changed a bit since last time. I realized adding lighting to the left or right of the sprite made it look very bad in-game, implying a source of light that&#8217;s inconsistent to everything else. Plus, the sprites were a bit too noisy, so I reduced the total number of colours used (even more).</p>
<p>On a side note, when the enemies are stunned, they are awfully bouncy&#8230;</p>
