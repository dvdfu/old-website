<p>Every stage of the game presents a different arrangement of blocks. The goal of each stage is to destroy (i.e. &#8220;mine&#8221;) every block with a gem in it to collect the gem. Every gem must be collected, none are to remain to pass a stage.</p>
<p>There are many ways to collect gems:</p>
<ul><li>dump the block in water</li>
<li>place a block on gates (those black bars) and activate the gates by placing a block on its button</li>
<li>match neighbouring gem block edges</li>
<li>surround a block with 4 gems facing towards it, also destroying the center block</li>
<li>use a dynamite (unpictured)</li>
</ul><p>As you can imagine, there are many strategies and many level possibilities. These above tools may help or hinder your level progress. I should make it clear that the footage above is just to test all of these features, though, real levels will usually have very few gems and involve a lot of clever thinking to collect them all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the process of figuring out how to store level data. I could make the data human-readable: &#8220;<span>Hannah and the Pirate Caves&#8221; did this on Neopets - their levels could be built in a text editor. But s</span><span>ince this is an app and no one needs to or can see the level data in plain text, I&#8217;m considering something more abstract. Right now, all of the block&#8217;s true/false properties are converted to two-digit hex, but it&#8217;s a bit more complicated for objects like button-gate pairs and 2-way paths. I feel like once I know how to read/write level data I can make a lot of more presentable progress.</span></p>
