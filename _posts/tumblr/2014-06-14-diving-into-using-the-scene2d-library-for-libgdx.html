Pretty much eliminates anything remotely complicated when trying to implement a scene graph.</p>
<p>I found out the way Scene2D implements collision detection using the exact same approach I&#8217;ve already used, which is a bit useless to me. Fortunately Scene2D makes it very easy to group objects, perform grouped object transformations/rotation/scaling, and sorts objects by render depth. If I&#8217;m smart about how I manage my game objects, collision handling shouldn&#8217;t be terribly slow. I would like to handle some of the nitty gritty programming parts of a game at some point, but I also don&#8217;t want to have to make a worse version of what already exists.</p>
<p>The game pictured is derived from the Paper Plane microgame from the WarioWare series. You can steer the plane left or right, and it travels very quickly when pointed downward. I put in a trail of animated red petals (?) that is really just eye candy.</p>
<p>Which reminds me to look into the particle effects tool for libgdx, although I&#8217;m not sure how it supports animated particles.</p>
