<p>Today I worked with the browser port for libgdx games. I still don&#8217;t fully know how to export browser-ready games, and I probably won&#8217;t be able to find out until after I have my own server to upload files onto. I can still compile and test games in web browsers, but it is somewhat problematic:</p>
<ul><li>libgdx uses WebGL to run its games, which is not supported by the latest versions of Firefox</li>
<li>On Chrome, the plugin must be installed, and even then I had to disable settings to allow WebGL to run</li>
<li>When it&#8217;s working, the program is incredibly unresponsive and updates frames only every few seconds</li>
<li>The screen isn&#8217;t fully rendered in this case (the two missing tiles in the top-right corner are present on the desktop version)</li>
</ul><p>Doing some research, the HTML game must be fully compiled/exported/hosted on a server, otherwise its performance while testing is incredibly sluggish. However, even exporting such a simple game takes between 2-3 minutes, so it&#8217;s not feasible to export whenever I want to test. Luckily, I can still use the desktop version to test.</p>
<p>The program I wrote is a very simple. It creates an array <span></span><span>(one-dimensional) </span><span>of colors, draws square tiles of a given width according to the colors in the array, and updates each tile&#8217;s RGB component based on its proximity to the input coordinates (in this case, the mouse).</span></p>
<p><span>I want to distribute any simple or experimental games I make onto web browsers: I think they are the most accessible and will have the largest audience. I will have to look more into libgdx and WebGL, first.</span></p>
