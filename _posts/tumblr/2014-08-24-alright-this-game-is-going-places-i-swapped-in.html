This game is <em>going</em> places. I swapped in some Mario Bros. sprites because I don&#8217;t have any of my own, yet. I realized I really dislike creating animations for games&#8230;mainly because I&#8217;m no good at it. Anyway, here&#8217;s some details and commentary.</p>
<ol><li>I tweaked the gameplay a lot from the previous screenshot set. Stunned enemies escape stun after 3 seconds and in general are used a lot differently. But the principle is more or less the same: stomp on enemies to stun, grabbed stunned enemies and throw them to kill.</li>
<li>Added the rising floor. It takes 5 enemies entering the lava for it to completely engulf the first floor. If the player is quick, they can reach the second floor and have another 3 enemies before guaranteed death, but at this point, it&#8217;s significantly harder to keep enemies out.</li>
</ol><p>Here are some things that I tried that did NOT work:</p>
<ul><li>Wrapping levels: players and enemies walk through the left side, come out the right, and vice-versa. Failed because it made the game too easy. The player&#8217;s position and throwing angle hardly mattered, and there was no real decision making</li>
<li>Enemy HP: some enemies took multiple hits to kill, but this was far too difficult to keep track of. A player should see an enemy and always know it&#8217;s just one hit away from death</li>
<li>"Flowerpot": I toyed with an idea where instead of preventing enemies from falling off the stage, you have to prevent them from touching a flowerpot (which you could also carry around like an enemy). Way too difficult, and it encouraged staying in one spot all the time</li>
</ul><p>On a side note, I think I might also repurpose this blog into general programming progress. I&#8217;ve been learning a bunch of other languages and frameworks beyond Java/libGDX, and this would be the right place to put any other projects.</p>
