Level data looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>name;8;10;03b;04b;05b;06b;07b;09sh;10bam;11&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s human readable, and possible to build levels straight from notepad (which is advised against). The real progress was that I made a built-in level editor. The tab key switches between edit/play (you can&#8217;t tell in the images). If I ever port this feature to mobile, I would add touch-based buttons to select tools, so it would look something like a paint program. The level editor even comes with undo/redo functions that I built with stacks.</p>
<p>In the images, you&#8217;ll see that I&#8217;m adding and changing the properties of blocks, and then immediately going live with the updates and playing the level. By &#8220;going live&#8221;, the game quickly saves the level data to a local directory and immediately loads/renders it.</p>
<p>On top of all of that, I looked into porting to HTML and hosting it on GitHub using gh-pages. From GitHub&#8217;s point of view this was a terrible idea, since the generated HTML files were in the tens of thousands of lines, and it rendered my repository statistics useless. The game seems to host fairly well, although it doesn&#8217;t run on Safari and has serious audio lag.</p>
