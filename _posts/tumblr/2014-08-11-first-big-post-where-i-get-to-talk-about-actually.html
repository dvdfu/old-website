I want to emphasize that all of the graphics are just placeholders. <span>Here&#8217;s a note for each of the screengrabs:</span><span><br/></span></p>
<ol><li>The enemies (green) spawn and walk around the map. Your goal is to stop them from entering the pit at the bottom. Every enemy you fail to prevent will raise a floor of spikes, or lava, or something. You can jump on them a la Mario Bros. and they will be stunned (yellow)</li>
<li>You can walk up to a stunned enemy and grab it (blue). You can drop off a stunned enemy&#8230;or use it as a shield and KO other enemies by walking into them (they turn pink)</li>
<li>Active enemies can walk into stunned enemies. This causes them to change directions. You can strategically place stunned enemies to redirect active ones in this way.</li>
<li>If you release an enemy while holding a direction, you throw them (they turn red) and they can KO other enemies. You can aim them in any direction, it feels pretty smooth.</li>
</ol><p>Some more commentaries:</p>
<p><span>The game encourages aggressive play, not camping. You can &#8220;trap&#8221; enemies between two stunned ones, but the stunned ones get pushed back when they collide. It only works for so long before you need to go out and stomp on more enemies.</span></p>
<p>Enemies will vary widely. They also appear in higher frequencies as the game progresses. They drop randomized powerups that the player can swap in (the player only holds the 2 or 3 most recently picked up powerups). I wanted each game to be a little different so I&#8217;m thinking of dozens and dozens of powerups, all unique. More on that later.</p>
<p>Lastly, the stage. <span>There are a lot of tricks I discovered from only playing a bit so far. I really like the idea of letting the player develop little strategies. </span><span>Here are some design decisions so far:</span></p>
<ul><li>Enemies only spawn from the top left or right, dropping them directly onto the player gives too little time to react and is unfair</li>
<li>They spawn on the opposite side of where they will, by default, fall into the pit. They stay on the stage for the longest time</li>
<li>It is not normally possible for the player to reach to top levels, but they can by timing jumps on falling enemies. The game also takes place on these top platforms once the spikes/lava/floor hazard has risen too high. At this point enemies will fall in incredibly fast and the player has little ability to toss enemies across floors</li>
</ul>
