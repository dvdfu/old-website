I&#8217;ll call them fire goblins for now.Â The enemies needed to quickly convey three things:</p>
<ol><li>They could be attacked by jumping on them</li>
<li>When jumped on, their stunned bodies could be used as a projectile, very much like Koopas and Koopa shells. In this case, the fire goblins retreat inside their rock and pretty much look like just a rock</li>
<li>They need to be hot. I needed a reason to show that if they went into the lava in an un-stunned state, they would raise the level of lava. It still doesn&#8217;t make perfect sense, but it will suffice</li>
</ol><p>There are also other things to consider: how hard will they be to animate? How can a player distinguish between different types of enemies? I&#8217;ve shown two examples here of a basic walking fire goblin, and a legless one that jumps high and moves like a frog.</p>
<p>Neither of the designs are final, but they&#8217;re the closest I&#8217;ve got to finalized so far.</p>
