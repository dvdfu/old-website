	<div class="divider"></div>
	<p>I'm David. I'm 18 years old and currently studying as a Software Engineer at the University of Waterloo.</p>
	<p>Learning how to use and write software of all kinds interests me. I'm particularly passionate about developing and designing video games, on top of illustration, animation, music composition and performance.</p>
