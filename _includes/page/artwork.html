<p>Digital art is something on which I've spent a large part of my life. I'm a big fan of animation, cartoons, and video games, so most of my artwork depict characters and worlds from them. Here are just a few of my most recent drawings.</p>
<div class="panel-images">
	{% for drawing in site.data.drawings %}
	<a href="/img/art/{{ drawing.filename }}" data-lightbox="art" data-title="{{ drawing.description }}">
		<img class="artwork-images" src="/img/previews/{{ drawing.filename }}" width="200px">
	</a>
	{% endfor %}
