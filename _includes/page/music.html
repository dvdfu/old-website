	<p>Playing music is one of my most relaxing pasttimes. I've played piano since age 6 and have since learned - mostly independently - the guitar, drums, trumpet, and violin.</p>
	<p>I also like to arrange music. Some of it is original, but a lot of it consists of recreations of existing songs. This section will be updated with some of my music.</p>
