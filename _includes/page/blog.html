	<p>I love games: making them, designing them, and playing them. Game creation has been a major hobby of mine for as long as I can remember. Currently, I'm using libGDX and Java to create video games for desktop and mobile platforms.<p>
	<p>This section of my website is still under construction. I plan to include built-in blog posts here using Tumblr's API. For now, you can visit my game development blog <a href="http://dvdfu.tumblr.com/">here</a>.<p>
